# Cesar Melchor Photography Website

This is a website that will showcase all my images. I decided to go for a minimal design. 

I also decided to style this with Tailwind CSS. I had never used it before so I wanted to try it out and see how it went. I really liked how everything is on one file and I did not have to go back and forth between style sheets and js files. I have used styled componenets, but it personally makes the file clumpy. I liked Tailwind CSS better.
